# Data (if large - though user requested code push, large datasets are usually ignored, but here it seems the dataset is not in the root or is small enough/synthesized elsewhere. The prompt said "entire codebase". I'll exclude standard temp stuff.)
# If "Dataset" folder exists and is huge, we might ignore it, but I'll keep it open unless I see it.
# Based on file list, no Dataset folder in root.

# Models (User mentioned checking size. H5 files were ~1.8MB, so they are fine to commit)
# *.h5
# *.keras
